I think root cause analysis is more important than retrospective.
This is because retrospection is a way of approaching issues with intuition and intuition based on experience,
which may not be effective in reality, whereas root cause analysis is based on more specific and factual evidence based on facts,
so reasonable conclusions can be drawn. Because you can.
